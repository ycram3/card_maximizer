# card_maximizer
Final Project CSC 660/680

Name: Marcello Rusciano

SFSU ID: 917213120

Semester: Fall 2022

Summury:
The App recognize your location and based on that it will tell you what is the best credit card to use in that specific store.
The choice of the credit card is based on the rewards you will get using one specific card. 
The most valueble reward (cashback/points) will be the main factor which will determine what card the app will suggest the user.
For example, if our location understands that we are inside a restaurant it will suggest us to use, among the credit cards we previously inserted, which card has the highest cashback.
In this way we will always maximize how much money we are getting back.

Proposal:
Must have features: 
  - Getting the location
  - Suggesting the card
Nice to have feature:
  - Be able to make a payment with that card
